# Manual Testing Portfolio – Web Applications

This repository contains **manual test cases created by me** for testing real web applications.
The test cases are designed based on the actual UI and behavior of each application and focus on clear, structured, and practical manual testing documentation.

## Scope of Testing
This repository currently includes manual test cases for the following web application:

- **AutomationExercise**  
  Website: https://automationexercise.com  
  Module Tested:
  - User Registration
  - User Login
  - User Logout

Additional test cases for other web applications may be added in the future.

## Test Case Approach
- Test cases are written with clear and ordered test steps describing user actions.
- Each test case has a single expected result that represents the overall outcome of the scenario.
- Actual result and execution status (Pass/Fail) are recorded per test case.
- Test data is defined for each test case to support repeatable execution.
- The structure is designed for efficiency and real project usage, avoiding unnecessary duplication.

## Test Scenario Structure
The test scenarios use a simple and consistent ID format:

- **TS.Auth.001** – Register
- **TS.Auth.002** – Login
- **TS.Auth.003** – Logout

Test Case ID format:
TS.Auth.<Scenario>.<TestCase>


## Documentation Format
Each test case includes:
- Test Scenario ID
- Test Case ID
- Description
- Preconditions
- Test steps
- Test data
- Expected result
- Actual result
- Execution status
- Remarks

## Repository Usage
- Open the test case files using Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets
- Review and execute test cases manually
- Compare expected and actual results
- Use as a reference for manual testing practice or interview preparation

## Notes
- Screenshots and execution evidence may be provided via external links (e.g. Google Drive).
- This repository will be continuously updated as new applications are tested.
